## Teaching Experience

With extensive teaching experience in both Canadian and Bangladeshi curricula, I have successfully instructed high school students in Mathematics and Physics, employing innovative teaching methods to enhance understanding and engagement. My experience includes online instruction for the Canadian curriculum, where I adapted lessons to suit a virtual learning environment.
